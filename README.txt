[b][u]Description[/u][/b]
This is a small script that becomes active whenever you're inspecting a container, like a chest or NPC's inventory. When you press the [font=Courier New]T[/font]
 key on your keyboard, it will move all the "common" items from that container into your inventory.

Most of the time when you're looting in a dungeon, you don't need to pick up anything other than valuables and consumables from containers. So this hopefully covers most of those cases.

List of affected items:
[list]
[*]Gold
[*]Lockpicks
[*]Gems (VendorItemGem)
[*]Ores and Ingots (VendorItemOreIngot)
[*]Potions (VendorItemPotion)
[*]Amulets, Necklaces and Rings (ArmorJewelry, VendorItemJewelry, ClothingNecklace)
[*]Soul Gems
[*]Keys
[*]Magic Scrolls 
[*]Arrows (Ammo)
[/list]
